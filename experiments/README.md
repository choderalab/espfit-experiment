## Notes
Each directory is a workspace for a different espaloma model (see main README.md for more details). The basic constuction of the directories are as follows:
- `spice2-default/`
    - `data/` - directory to download QC data
    - `train/` - directory to train and evaluate espaloma
    - `benchmark/` - directory to perform benchmark experiments
